# Calculator

A basic 4 function calculator written in Javascript using React UI framework

## To use

Clone repo into new directory, change to directory, `npm install` the dependencies (takes a long time) then run `npm start` to run code. It may open a browser window automatically. If not then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` manually.

## Motivation

To apply my React knowledge to an original (for me) project.
